Project Overview

In this project, I assume the role of a Data Scientist / Data Analyst working for a new startup investment firm that helps customers invest their money in stocks. My job is to extract financial data like historical share price and quarterly revenue reportings from various sources using Python libraries and webscraping on popular stocks. After collecting this data, I visualize it in a dashboard to identify patterns or trends. The stocks I worked with are Tesla and GameStop.

Dashboard Analytics Displayed

A dashboard often provides a view of key performance indicators in a clear way. It usually consists of graphs and visual summaries of important metrics.I analyze the data set and extract key performance indicators and display the resulting data in dashboards. I use Plotly in this project for data visualization.

I also use Watson Studio in this project. Watson studio is a component of IBM Cloud Pak for Data, a suite of tools and a collaborative environment for data scientists, data analysts, AI and machine learning engineers and domain experts to develop and deploy projects.

Extracting essential data from a dataset and displaying it is a necessary part of data science; therefore individuals can make correct decisions based on the data. The resources used in the project are by IBM's Skills Network.
